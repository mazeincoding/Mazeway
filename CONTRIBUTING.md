## What this project is about

Think of this as the authentication foundation that developers can actually build on. Just like how Shadcn UI revolutionized UI components by making them customizable, we're doing the same for auth.

We focus purely on authentication. That means:
- ‚úÖ Email verification
- ‚úÖ Device management
- ‚úÖ Security alerts
- ‚úÖ Basic user settings (email, password, name)
- ‚ùå In-app notifications (not auth-related)
- ‚ùå User profiles (usernames, bios, profile pages, etc)

This keeps the project focused while giving developers a solid foundation they can extend.

We also like simple solutions. That way, the project is easier to pick up on.

## Be awesome to each other

A few ground rules:
- Be kind and helpful
- Focus on solutions, not blame
- Welcome newcomers
- Share knowledge

Let's make authentication great again!
