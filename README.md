# Mazeway Auth

Authentication should live in your project, not a node_modules folder.

Think Clerk, but you own the code.

This is a complete, production-ready auth starter for anyone, including enterprise.

People like [Shadcn UI](ui.shadcn.com) because:
- the components are in YOUR project
- you own them
- you can do whatever you want
- they don't belong in a node_modules folder

Comparing Shadcn UI to bootstrap is like comparing Mazeway to Clerk:

**Clerk**:
- locked in
- gets expensive quick
- can't self host
- limited customization
- closed-source
- still lacks some auth (that you can't add)

**Mazeway**:
- affordable thanks to Supabase
- can be self-hosted
- unlimited customization
- open-source
- actual complete auth
- plus:
    - community-driven
    - more secure
    - more secure
    - auth config to change common things
    - later: extensions by the community
    - acts as a foundation, not a final product. Start here, build on it.

The project uses modern tech:
- Next.js 15
- Tailwind CSS
- Shadcn UI
- Supabase
- Resend
- Upstash Redis

(not all these are required to set up. Because this project is made for that - being minimal)

I see a lot of new apps having only 5% of authentication. Including:
- Missing login page
- No "forgot password" option
- Missing crucial security (2FA, device sessions, email alerts, and more)
- Weird UI glitches with auth
- No way to connect account to multiple providers (or delete some)
- DDoS attacks for not having proper security and API rate limiting
- HUGE bills, for lack of security again
- This list is usually longer but you get the point

These are the kind of things that should be implemented by default.

That's what this project gives you: a foundation that you can build on.

This starter pack includes all of that, and more.

## The project comes with:
- Sign-in options:
    - `Email/password`
    - `Google`
- Complete authentication flow:
  - Login/signup pages
  - Password reset
  - Device sessions tracking
  - Two-factor authentication (2FA):
      - Authenticator App
      - SMS
      - Backup codes
- Settings
  - Basic profile management
  - Change password
  - Device session management
    - View active sessions
    - Revoke device access
    - Email alerts for new logins
  - ~~Account activity tracking~~ (later)
    - ~~View activity history (logins, disable 2FA, etc)~~
    - ~~Get alerts for sensitive activity (unknown device login, etc)~~
  - Enable and disable 2FA (including individual methods)
- Verification:
    - 2FA methods (Authenticator, SMS)
    - Backup codes (for 2FA-accounts)
        - Cryptographically secure
        - Supports multiple formats (words, alphanumeric, numeric)
    - Password verification (no-2FA accounts with password)
    - Email verification (no-2FA accounts)
- API rate limiting with Upstash Redis
- Bonus: a nice auth config in the project for devs to easily customize things (opens up more things than on this list)

This is only the beginning.
  
## Quick setup (development)

### 1. Install dependencies
In the terminal, run this:
```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Set up Supabase
1. Create a Supabase project
    - Go to [Supabase](https://supabase.com/dashboard/projects)
    - If you don't have an account, create one
    - Click "New project"
    - Name it "my-app-dev" (your actual app name), choose location and generate database password
    - Name it "my-app-dev" (your actual app name), choose location and generate database password
2.  Get API keys
    - Once the project is fully created, go to [API Settings](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/_/settings/api)
    - Once the project is fully created, go to [API Settings](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/_/settings/api)
    - Get your "Project URL", "anon" key and "service_role" key

    > Note that Supabase is changing "anon" and "service_role" to "publishable" and "secret". This may have changed when you're reading this.
3. Update environment variables
    - Open the `.env.example` file
    - Copy the contents to a new file called `.env.local`
    - Replace the values with your own:
        - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`: your project URL from step 2
        - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`: your anon/publishable key from step 2
        - `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`: your service role/secret key from step 2

    > Note: The ANON key is designed to be public! See [Reddit discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/Supabase/comments/1fcndq7/is_it_safe_to_expose_my_supabase_url_and/) and [Supabase docs](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/api/api-keys)

4. Create Supabase tables
    - Head over to the [Supabase SQL Editor](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/_/sql/new)
    - Run these [code snippets](docs/supabase-snippets.md)

5. Change email templates
    - Go to [Supabase Email Templates](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/_/auth/templates)
    - Copy these [email templates](docs/supabase-email-templates.md)

6. Set up Google OAuth and connect to Supabase

This will allow users to sign in with Google.

Good to know:
- this project is moving towards a "config-based" approach
- where you can enable/disable what you want
- that means, Google Auth is going to an optional feature
- for now, it's required

    1. Get your Google OAuth credentials
        - Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
        - Create/select project in console
        - Go to: [https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials/consent](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials/consent)
        - Choose "External". ("Internal" might be disabled)
    
    2. Configure OAuth consent screen
        - Enter your app name in the "App name" field (eg: auth-starter)
        - Click the "user support email" dropdown and select your email here
        - You can upload a logo if you want. The auth will work either way
        - Scroll down to the "Authorized domains" heading and click the "ADD DOMAIN" button. Enter your Supabase project URL here. We got this in the early steps. Should look like `<PROJECT_ID>.supabase.co`.
        - Scroll down to the "Developer contact information" heading and add your email.
    
        > Note: The URL shouldn't include the `https://` part
    
    3. Create OAuth credentials
        - Go to: [https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials)
        - Click "create credentials"
        - Choose "OAuth Client ID".
        - For "Application type", choose "Web application".
        - Under "Authorized JavaScript origins", add your site URL. That's `http://localhost:3000` (don't worry about your custom domain or production)
        - Under "Authorized redirect URLs", enter the "callback URL" from the Supabase dashboard. To get it, follow these steps:
            1. Go to [Supabase Auth Providers](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/_/auth/providers)
            2. Scroll down until you see "Google" and expand it
            3. You'll find a field labeled "Callback URL (for OAuth)"".
        - In the Google console, click "create" and you will be shown your "Client ID" and "Client secret"
        - Copy those, go back to Supabbase and paste those. Then click "Save"

7. Add your redirect URL in Supabase
    - Go [here](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/_/auth/url-configuration)
    - Add a redirect URL `http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback`

If you have trouble following along, you can check the official docs [here](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth/social-login/auth-google). You can also open a GitHub issue.

### 3. Set up Resend (optional)
Supabase (as of now) does give you 2 free emails per hour but it's unreliable. Sometimes, unclear errors will pop up because of their SMTP and you'll spend 2 hours debugging.

You can totally skip setting up Resend (during development) but be mindful that if auth doesn't work, setting up a custom SMTP will probably fix it.

Aside from that, the project uses Resend for:
- email login alerts
- device verification

If you don't set up Resend:
- The code won't attempt to use Resend at all
- All devices will be "trusted" by default, which doesn't matter for development

When you go in production, I recommend you set it up. Because:
- you just need to get an API key and put it in the environment variables (`.env.local`).
- you don't need to change any code
- auth is supposed to be secure in production
- you'll need a domain but you would anyway without Resend

With that out the way, here's how to do it:

**Luckily...**
Resend makes it really straightforward to integrate with Supabase.

You won't even need to touch the Supabase dashboard to do it.

1. Create Resend account and set up domain
    - Go to the [Resend website](https://resend.com)
    - Create an account/login
    - Go to [Domains](https://resend.com/domains)
    - If you already have a domain here (that you wanna use) you can skip this. But if you don't got one (or want a new one) follow the steps by Resend. It should be clear what to do, but hit me up on [X (Twitter)](https://x.com/mazewinther1) if you're having trouble and I'll personally help you. You can also open a GitHub issue.

    > Note: You will need a paid domain for this as mentioned above.
    
    > You can add any domain by the way. I'm on the Resend free tier so I added my personal domain (mazewinther.com). You know why? Because the free tier only gets you 1 domain, so by using my personal domain, I can re-use it for all of my apps and it still makes sense.
    >
    > If I were to add my app's domain, it'd only really make sense to use for that one app.
    >
    > If you're on a paid tier, just add your app's domain because you can have multiple domains. This is only a tip for people who wan't wanna spend money right away.
    >
    > Though Resend is really amazing, and I'd probably subscribe just to support the service itself.

2. Set up API key and Supabase integration
    - Once you have a domain, go to [API Keys](https://resend.com/api-keys) and click "Create API key"
    - Enter a name for the API key (like your app name), then change "permission" to "Sending access" and click the "Domain" field to change it to the one you just added
    - Now go to [Integrations](https://resend.com/settings/integrations)
    - You should see Supabase listed. Click "Connect to Supabase"
    - Resend will request access to your Supabase organization. Click "Authorize Resend"
    - Select your Supabase project
    - Select the domain you just added
    - Configure custom SMTP (this sounds super complicated but it's not. It's already configured. Just change the `Sender name` and click `Configure SMTP integration`)
    - Update your `.env.local` file to add these (this is because aside from Supabase, the project uses Resend too):
    ```diff
    - RESEND_API_KEY=your-resend-api-key
    - RESEND_FROM_EMAIL="Auth <auth@yourdomain.com>"
    + RESEND_API_KEY=your-resend-api-key
    + RESEND_FROM_EMAIL="Your_name <example@yourdomain.com>"
    ```

Congrats! 🎉 You just set up everything you need for the auth to work. You can go ahead and run `npm run dev` in the terminal, and head over to `http://localhost:3000` in the browser to test it out.

> [!NOTE]
> When running the dev server, you may see a warning in your console about `supabase.auth.getSession()` being potentially insecure. This is a [known issue](https://github.com/supabase/auth-js/issues/873) with the Supabase auth library and can be safely ignored. The warning is a false positive - this project follows all security best practices and uses the recommended `@supabase/ssr` package correctly.

        - Under "Authorized redirect URLs", enter the "callback URL" from the Supabase dashboard. To get it, follow these steps:
            1. Go to [Supabase Auth Providers](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/_/auth/providers)
            1. Go to [Supabase Auth Providers](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/_/auth/providers)
            2. Scroll down until you see "Google" and expand it
            3. You'll find a field labeled "Callback URL (for OAuth)"".
        - In the Google console, click "create" and you will be shown your "Client ID" and "Client secret"
        - In the Google console, click "create" and you will be shown your "Client ID" and "Client secret"
        - Copy those, go back to Supabbase and paste those. Then click "Save"

### 3. Set up Resend (optional)
Supabase (as of now) does give you 2 free emails per hour but it's unreliable. Sometimes, unclear errors will pop up because of their SMTP and you'll spend 2 hours debugging.

You can totally skip setting up Resend (during development) but be mindful that if auth doesn't work, setting up a custom SMTP will probably fix it.

Aside from that, the project uses Resend for:
- email login alerts
- device verification

If you don't set up Resend:
- The code won't attempt to use Resend at all
- All devices will be "trusted" by default, which doesn't matter for development

When you go in production, I recommend you set it up. Because:
- you just need to get an API key and put it in the environment variables (`.env.local`).
- you don't need to change any code
- auth is supposed to be secure in production
- you'll need a domain but you would anyway without Resend

With that out the way, here's how to do it:

**Luckily...**
Resend makes it really straightforward to integrate with Supabase.

You won't even need to touch the Supabase dashboard to do it.

1. Create Resend account and set up domain
    - Go to the [Resend website](https://resend.com)
    - Create an account/login
    - Go to [Domains](https://resend.com/domains)
    - If you already have a domain here (that you wanna use) you can skip this. But if you don't got one (or want a new one) follow the steps by Resend. It should be clear what to do, but hit me up on [X (Twitter)](https://x.com/mazewinther1) if you're having trouble and I'll personally help you. You can also open a GitHub issue.

    > Note: You will need a paid domain for this as mentioned above.
    
    > You can add any domain by the way. I'm on the Resend free tier so I added my personal domain (mazewinther.com). You know why? Because the free tier only gets you 1 domain, so by using my personal domain, I can re-use it for all of my apps and it still makes sense.
    >
    > If I were to add my app's domain, it'd only really make sense to use for that one app.
    >
    > If you're on a paid tier, just add your app's domain because you can have multiple domains. This is only a tip for people who wan't wanna spend money right away.
    >
    > Though Resend is really amazing, and I'd probably subscribe just to support the service itself.

2. Set up API key and Supabase integration
    - Once you have a domain, go to [API Keys](https://resend.com/api-keys) and click "Create API key"
    - Enter a name for the API key (like your app name), then change "permission" to "Sending access" and click the "Domain" field to change it to the one you just added
    - Now go to [Integrations](https://resend.com/settings/integrations)
    - You should see Supabase listed. Click "Connect to Supabase"
    - Resend will request access to your Supabase organization. Click "Authorize Resend"
    - Select your Supabase project
    - Select the domain you just added
    - Configure custom SMTP (this sounds super complicated but it's not. It's already configured. Just change the `Sender name` and click `Configure SMTP integration`)
    - Update your `.env.local` file to add these (this is because aside from Supabase, the project uses Resend too):
    ```diff
    - RESEND_API_KEY=your-resend-api-key
    - RESEND_FROM_EMAIL="Auth <auth@yourdomain.com>"
    + RESEND_API_KEY=your-resend-api-key
    + RESEND_FROM_EMAIL="Your_name <example@yourdomain.com>"
    ```

Congrats! 🎉 You just set up everything you need for the auth to work. You can go ahead and run `npm run dev` in the terminal, and head over to `http://localhost:3000` in the browser to test it out.

> [!NOTE]
> When running the dev server, you may see a warning in your console about `supabase.auth.getSession()` being potentially insecure. This is a [known issue](https://github.com/supabase/auth-js/issues/873) with the Supabase auth library and can be safely ignored. The warning is a false positive - this project follows all security best practices and uses the recommended `@supabase/ssr` package correctly.

## Recommended for production
The features/things listed below are completely optional for development.

If you want, you can do them right away. That's up to you.

But I highly recommend you do it when you go in production.

### Change Email OPT Expiration
By default, Supabase likes to put it at 24 hours.

That makes zero sense because then they tell you to lower it to 1 hour (or below).

So let's go ahead and make Supabase (and your users) happy:
1. Go to [Supabase Auth Providers](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/_/auth/providers)
1. Go to [Supabase Auth Providers](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/_/auth/providers)
2. Expand the "Email" provider
3. Scroll down to "Email OTP Expiration"
4. Set it to "1800" (1 hour)
5. Click "Save"

### Clean up database automatically
Some things will pile up in your database over time (verification codes, expired device sessions, eg), but it's not that crucial to clean them up right away.

Even in early production, your database won't explode from some old data lying around (most data gets cleared by the code)
Even in early production, your database won't explode from some old data lying around (most data gets cleared by the code)

If you do want to set it up, check out [this guide](docs/cleanup-setup.md).
If you do want to set it up, check out [this guide](docs/cleanup-setup.md).

### API Rate limiting (with Upstash Redis)

Yes, this does introduce another service you'll need to set up but:
- you literally need to get 2 API keys.
- takes a minute or so to do

Here's how to do it:
1. Set up Upstash account and database
    - Go to the [Upstash website](https://console.upstash.com/login)
    - Go to the [Upstash website](https://console.upstash.com/login)
    - Create an account or log in
    - Click "create database"
    - Name it whatever you want like "auth-rate-limit"

2. Configure database settings
    - Primary region: wherever you plan to host your app.
    - It should be closest to where your Next.js app is hosted, not users, since the API endpoints in this project will use it.
    - If you're just setting up rate limiting for development, anything's fine.
    - Whenever you deploy your app (eg: Vercel, Netlify) you can specify a region.
    - Choose a plan: just go free for now because:
        - You get 10K commands per day
        - With API rate limiting, each API request might use 2-3 Redis commands to:
            - Get the current request count
            - Increment it
    - Click "create"

3. Get API credentials and update environment
    - Get your `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL` and `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN`:
        - Scroll down to the "REST API" section
        - Look above the code snippet, you should see them here
    - Update `.env.local` file to add these:
        ```diff
        - # UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL=your-upstash-redis-rest-url
        - # UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN=your-upstash-redis-rest-token
        + UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL=your-upstash-redis-rest-url
        + UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN=your-upstash-redis-rest-token
        ```

> In the auth config of this project (`src/config/auth.ts`) API rate limiting is already enabled by default. If you ever need (to test something for example), you can disable it in the config.

## Optional features

### SMS two-factor authentication
I really don't see why you'd do this because:
- Costs money (per SMS, monthly fees, registration fees)
- Compliance headaches (A2P 10DLC registration, carrier approvals)
- Different rates per country (good luck with that pricing)
- SMS can be delayed or fail
- Phone numbers change
- Authenticator apps are:
  - Free
  - Work offline
  - More secure
  - No compliance BS
  - No carrier drama

Good news:
- this starter does support SMS
- You don't need to dig into the code to implement it

But, consider if you really need this. The only benefit SMS has is:
- users know it
- not many even know what an authenticator app is

Though I can argue that point:
- if apps keep using SMS, users will NEVER adapt to anything more secure
- they don't know SMS isn't secure
- the more apps that start to ditch it (and introduce the apps) the faster users will adapt
- just like users adapted to making passwords more complicated (uppercase, special characters)

You know why users adapted to complex passwords? Because apps finally took ACTION.

They started throwing errors all around.

It's just a matter of time; what company is brave enough to make the move?

If you really want to flex that your auth system can do everything:

1. Create a Twilio account
    - Go to [Twilio's website](https://www.twilio.com/try-twilio)
    - Sign up for a free account
    - Verify your email and phone number
2. Get account credentials
    - After verification, you'll be taken to your console
    - If you didn't, here's a link: [Twilio Console](https://console.twilio.com/)
    - Scroll down to "Account Info"
    - You'll see:
    ```
    Account SID: AC********************************
    Auth Token: ********************************
    ```
    - We'll need to add these to Supabase in a bit. You can (temporarily) store them somewhere like a note. Just be sure to delete it when we're done.
3. Get a phone number
    - In Twilio Console, go to "Phone Numbers" > "Manage" > "Buy a number" (it's free)
    - Or direct link: [Buy a Number](https://console.twilio.com/us1/develop/phone-numbers/manage/search)
    - Click "Buy" on a number (trial accounts get a free number, you should have that if you just created it)
    - If you click "Configure number" you may see a warning and 2 notes
        - Don't let them overwhelm you. They just make shit seem overcomplicated for no reason.
        - First note about "A2P 10DLC":
            - Just a fancy way of saying "business texting from regular numbers"
            - US carriers want to prevent spam
            - Twilio makes businesses register their SMS use-case
            - Like telling them "yeah we're just doing 2FA codes"
            - Trial accounts can skip this (only needed for production)
        - Second note about some CSV Report:
            - Just a way to check if your numbers are registered
            - Again, trial accounts don't need this
            - It's for big companies managing lots of numbers
        - Last warning about "Emergency Address":
            - This doesn't even apply to us
            - Because we're only using SMS, no calls.
4. Create a Twilio messaging service
    - Direct link: [Create Messaging Service](https://console.twilio.com/us1/service/sms/create?frameUrl=%2Fconsole%2Fsms%2Fservices%2Fcreate%3Fx-target-region%3Dus1)
    - Friendly name: your app name (eg: My App)
    - Select "Verify users" as the use case
    - Click "Add Senders" on step 2,
    - For "Sender Type" the default should already be "Phone Number". If not, select that.
    - Click "Continue"
    - You should see the phone number listed that you bought earlier. Select it
    - Click "Add Phone Numbers"
    - Now, go to "Properties" (direct link: [Messaging Properties](https://console.twilio.com/us1/service/sms/_/messaging-service-properties?frameUrl=%2Fconsole%2Fsms%2Fservices%2FMG3fd63140e331b046c661d315701decbc%2Fproperties%3Fx-target-region%3Dus1))
    - Here, you'll find "Messaging Service SID". We're going to need this now! (along with the other things we got earlier)
5. Connect Supabase with Twilio
    - Go to [Supabase Auth Providers](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/_/auth/providers)
    - Go to [Supabase Auth Providers](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/_/auth/providers)
    - Expand "Phone" and enable it
    - SMS provider: Twilio
    - Twilio account SID: you got this from step 2
    - Twilio auth token: and this from step 2
    - Messaging Service SID: what we just got
    - Ignore the "Twilio Content SID" field because that's for WhatsApp
    - Turn OFF "enable phone confirmation" because:
        - it would force users to enter a phone number on sign up
        - it's different from 2FA (what we're doing)
        - so users will be able to sign up with email and password
        - then later, add their phone number as 2FA for extra security
    - Click "Save"
6. Update the auth config to enable SMS as a 2FA method:
```diff
{
    title: "SMS",
    description: "Receive a verification code via SMS",
-   enabled: false,
+   enabled: true,
    type: "sms" as TTwoFactorMethod,
}
```

What you need to know:
- for development (with a trial account) you can only send SMS messages to verified numbers
- "verified numbers" is the ones you manually verify in the Twilio console
- When you signed up for an account and verified a phone number, that counts as one.
- That means, when you try out the auth with SMS, use the phone number you verified to set up 2FA,
- When going in production, scroll down to the production checklist.

## Production checklist
1. Change logo throughout app
    - Firstly, you're gonna upload your logo to a CDN (super easy, I'll show you)
    - Reason: if you put it directly in the /public folder, email templates can't use your logo. So don't do that
    - Supabase ia actually great here. Here's what you're gonna do:
    - Go to [Supabase Storage](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/_/storage/buckets)
    - Click "New bucket" and name it "logo"
    - Turn on "Public bucket"
    - Click "Save"
    - Now click the budget to open it and upload your logo here
    - Pro tip: go to [Iloveimg.com](https://www.iloveimg.com/compress-image) and compress your image before uploading (not an ad)
    - See how easy that was? Now click your uploaded logo in the bucket and click "Get URL" on the right
    - Paste this URL throughout the entire app
        - `emails/components/header.tsx`
        - `src/components/header.tsx`
        - PLUS all the email templates in your Supabase dashboard (we set these up earlier)
2. Change branding color in emails
    - Even though you change the primary color in `src/app/globals.css`...
    - They're not applied to your email templates automatically
    - Double check the email templates in this project and the Supabase dashboard
3. Set up Resend
4. Set up Upstash Redis for API rate limiting
5. If you set up SMS for two-factor authentication:

## Get to know the project better

### Data Fetching Strategy: SWR + API Utility
You might notice we use two different approaches for handling data and API calls. This isn't an accident - each serves a specific purpose:

1. **SWR Hooks** (`/hooks/use-auth.ts`):
   - Think of these as "data subscribers"
   - Perfect for data that changes and needs to stay fresh (like user data)
   - Automatically revalidates when you:
     - Switch back to the tab
     - Reconnect to the internet
     - Make changes that affect the data
   - Example: `useUser()` hook keeps the user's data in sync across the app
   - Only handles reading and subscribing to data, not mutations

2. **API Utility** (`/utils/api.ts`):
   - Think of this as your "action caller"
   - Handles one-off actions like login, signup, or enabling 2FA
   - Provides consistent error handling (no more try-catch everywhere)
   - Gives you proper TypeScript types for requests/responses
   - Example: `api.auth.login()` for handling authentication
   - Only handles mutations and actions, not data subscriptions

How they work together:
1. API utility makes changes (like login)
2. API tells us if we need to refresh data
3. If needed, we use SWR's refresh function to update the data

Example:
```typescript
// 1. Call API to log in
const result = await api.auth.emailAuth({...});

// 2. API tells us if user data changed
if (result.shouldRefresh) {
  // 3. Use SWR to refresh the data
  await refreshUser();
}
```

This separation keeps things clean:
- SWR only cares about keeping data fresh
- API utility only cares about actions
- They work together but don't overlap
- Each piece has one clear job

### Types: where they are and why the naming convention
You might notice in the types (`/types`) we define interfaces and types with a prefix of "T". This is intentional to avoid name conflicts with components vs types.

Examples:
`TUser`
`TAuthError`

### API routes VS server actions: Why we use API routes
Server actions are just HTTP post requests. They seem "locked down" but they aren't entirely.

When this project started, I actually went with server actions for most things because I thought they were locked down to this Next.js app only. And I get it, it's not as straightforward as a simple API call but with enough digging, you could call the server actions.

What does that mean for security? They would need to have the same security checks as API routes (authorization)

So at this point, server actions end up with more downsides:
- Can't use routes outside of Next.js app (for mobile app etc)
- The `/auth/callback` and `/auth/confirm` routes need to be API routes because they're used by external services (OAuth)
- At that point, we'd end up with inconsistency

Pretty simple: we can't ONLY use server actions because of the OAuth routes. We CAN use only API routes though, and they allow us to use them from anywhere outside the Next.js app in the future.

### How auth errors work
The /auth/error page is just for generic, "can't recover" errors.

Usually, the API route responds with an error so the frontend can show it to the user.

In some cases, there is no frontend to display errors, for API routes like:
- callback
- confirm
- post-auth (after successful login/signup)

That's why we have a generic auth error page. For most stuff, the API responds with error/success.

### Email templates
Most templates will actually be in your Supabase dashboard. The ones you can find in there are:
- Confirm sign up
- Invite user
- Magic Link
- Change Email Address
- Reset Password
- Reauthentication

All other email templates live in this project in `/emails/templates`. You'll find:
- Verify device (`/emails/templates/device-verification.tsx`)
- Login alert (`/emails/templates/email-alert.tsx`)
- Verify email (`/emails/templates/email-verification.tsx`)

Separating the email templates wasn't a design choice. It sucks a little because you have email templates in 2 different places. But how often do you change these? Probably never. Not a huge concern. Just wanted to make you aware of that.

Now: coolest thing ever? The email templates in the project uses react-email (which is cool). Watch this:

try running this command in the terminal:
```bash
npx react-email dev
```

It should give you a localhost URL (eg: `http://localhost:3000`). Just copy that and paste it into the browser.

Next, expand "templates" in the sidebar and click any templates. You can preview them here! 🎉

### Auth config
To make things a little more manageable, there's a config file for the auth.

With this, you don't need to touch the core auth to make small tweaks (which could be risky if you don't know what you're doing). Of course, you will if there's no configuration for it. But there should be for most things that people would commonly change.

The config file is at `/config/auth.ts`.

### Separation of concerns
Most core auth lives in API routes.

It goes like this:
- API routes: doing actual things
- Pages: show things

For example, if the user logs in:
- ❌ We don't do this in a component:
```typescript
supabase.auth.signInWithEmailAndPassword();
```
- ✅ We call an API route to logout the user:
```typescript
import { api } from "@/utils/api";

api.auth.logout(); // this will do a fetch call instead of supabase,auth.logout();
```

Reasons:
1. Security: we never trust the client for things that need good security
2. Separation of concerns: auth lives in the API routes, components/pages handle the UI
3. Consistency: all auth flows go through API routes
4. Rate limiting: we can apply rate limiting to auth endpoints
5. Error handling: centralized error handling for auth operations
6. Logging: easier to track auth events and debug issues
7. Future-proofing: if we need to add more auth features, we know exactly where they go
8. ...probably more reasons, but you get the point.

### Difference between forgot password, change password and reset password
Notice how we got 3, very similar API routes?
- `/api/auth/forgot-password`
- `/api/auth/change-password`
- `/api/auth/reset-password`

The names look similar, but they serve entirely different purposes.

- `/api/auth/forgot-password`: Sends a password reset email

- `/api/auth/change-password`: Used to change the password of authenticated users. It accepts a current and new password.

- `/api/auth/reset-password`: Part of the forgot password flow: it takes a new password and a token, which it uses to update the password.

### API routes - returning success/error response VS redirecting
We're doing both. Why? Because it's not about consistency or standardizing one approach.

It's about doing what we need it to do:
- some API endpoints need to do their own thing (redirect to error page)
- other times, you need to respond with the error so the frontend can choose what happens

**Example of when API route needs to do its thing**
Let's imagine a user signs up with Google:
1. It hits our endpoint `/api/auth/google/signin`
1. Then some OAuth stuff from Google
2. Next goes to our endpoint `/api/auth/callback`
3. And finally `/api/auth2q`

There's no UI in these sequences. It's all magic server-side.

This is where we need to let the server decide what to do.

**Example of when UI needs to handle success/error**
Now let's imagine the user signs up with Email/Password:
1. Calls our API endpoint `/api/auth/email/signup`
2. If there's an error, there should be a clear error on the signup form (in the UI)
3. Redirecting to a general auth error page would be a way worse UX

Standardizing a single approach here adds zero benefits and introduces a lot of limits.

### Authentication Assurance Level (AAL)
> [!WARNING]
> Never trust `supabase.auth.mfa.getAuthenticatorAssuranceLevel()`. This is only set by Supabase and it doesn't reflect our app's logic.
>
> Instead, you should use our `getAuthenticatorAssuranceLevel` utility (`src/utils/auth.ts`) which respects backup codes.
>
> The reason is Supabase does not natively support backup codes. So we implement a custom solution. When a user verifies using one of these, we can't set `supabase.auth.mfa.getAuthenticatorAssuranceLevel`. Instead, we update the `aal` column on a device session to aal2 after successful verification.

## Pro tips + note for Supabase

**Pro tip!** If you find yourself cloning this project a lot but changing same things, fork the repo, tweak what you need and clone your repo instead. That way, you can customize everything you want once and re-use whenever.

If anyone at Supabase is reading, a "fork" feature (like GitHub) would push this project even further into it's direction of making complete authentication more accessible. When a Supabase project is forked, it'd be like duplicating that project to another user.

## Who is behind this?
I'm Maze, a developer whose X bio still reads "authentication is my only enemy". That bio exists for a reason - nobody wants to build complete auth for every project, even when using great tools like Supabase. There's still a lot of code to write, edge cases to handle, and features to implement.

So I thought: "What if there was a starter pack that could just give me complete auth, problem solved?" 

That's exactly what I built. If you hit any issues, open a GitHub issue. Alternatively, hit me up on [X (Twitter)](https://x.com/mazewinther1).
